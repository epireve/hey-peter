# HeyPeter Academy Production Data Seeding Guide

This guide provides comprehensive instructions for seeding the HeyPeter Academy database with realistic dummy data for testing all implemented systems.

## Overview

The production data seeding creates a realistic testing environment with:

- **50+ students** with varied profiles and progress levels
- **10 teachers** with different specializations and availability patterns  
- **200+ classes** scheduled across different time slots and courses
- **Comprehensive booking history** with realistic attendance patterns
- **Hour transaction data** including purchases and deductions
- **Feedback and assessment records** for performance analysis
- **Learning materials** structured across all course types

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Supabase CLI installed (`npm install -g supabase`)
- Project running locally (`supabase start`)
- Database reset capability for clean seeding

### Execute Seeding

```bash
# Make the script executable (if not already)
chmod +x scripts/run-production-seeding.sh

# Run the comprehensive seeding process
./scripts/run-production-seeding.sh
```

The script will:
1. ‚úÖ Validate prerequisites
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è Request confirmation for data insertion
3. üíæ Create database backup information
4. üå± Execute the seeding SQL script
5. üîç Validate data integrity
6. üìä Display summary statistics

## Manual Seeding (Alternative)

If the automated script fails, you can manually execute:

```bash
# Reset database
supabase db reset

# Execute seeding script
psql "$(supabase status | grep 'DB URL' | awk '{print $3}')" -f scripts/seed-production-data.sql
```

## Data Validation

After seeding, verify the data integrity:

```sql
-- Check student distribution
SELECT test_level, COUNT(*) FROM students GROUP BY test_level ORDER BY test_level;

-- Check class capacity utilization  
SELECT AVG(current_enrollment), AVG(max_capacity) FROM classes;

-- Check hour balance distribution
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE hour_balance < 5) as low_balance,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE hour_balance BETWEEN 5 AND 20) as medium_balance,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE hour_balance > 20) as high_balance
FROM students;

-- Check booking success rate
SELECT 
  attendance_status, 
  COUNT(*), 
  ROUND(COUNT(*)::NUMERIC / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER () * 100, 2) as percentage
FROM bookings 
WHERE attendance_status IN ('present', 'absent')
GROUP BY attendance_status;
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Supabase not running**: Execute `supabase start` before seeding
2. **Permission errors**: Ensure database has proper RLS policies disabled for seeding
3. **Constraint violations**: Reset database completely before re-seeding
4. **Memory issues**: Increase database memory if seeding large datasets

### Clean Re-seeding

```bash
# Complete reset and re-seed
supabase db reset
./scripts/run-production-seeding.sh
```

### Selective Data Reset

```sql
-- Clear only transactional data (keep users/courses)
DELETE FROM feedback;
DELETE FROM hour_transactions;  
DELETE FROM bookings;
DELETE FROM attendance;
-- Then re-run specific sections of seeding script
```

## Security Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: This seeding creates test accounts with default passwords. In production:

1. **Change all default passwords** immediately
2. **Enable Row Level Security** policies  
3. **Review user permissions** and access controls
4. **Monitor authentication** logs and activity
5. **Implement proper backup** procedures

## Next Steps

After successful seeding:

1. üöÄ **Start development server**: `npm run dev`
2. üîê **Test authentication** with seeded accounts
3. üìä **Explore admin dashboard** for system overview
4. üìö **Test 1v1 booking** with student accounts
5. üìß **Verify email notifications** in service logs
6. ü§ñ **Test AI scheduling** with various scenarios
7. üí∞ **Validate hour management** workflows
8. üìà **Review analytics** and performance metrics

The comprehensive seeding provides a production-like environment for thorough testing of all HeyPeter Academy systems! üéâ
