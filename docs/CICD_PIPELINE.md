## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. **GitHub Repository Setup**
   - Enable GitHub Actions
   - Configure repository secrets (see Secrets section)
   - Set up environments (development, staging, production)

2. **External Services**
   - Supabase project for each environment
   - Container registry access (GitHub Container Registry)
   - Monitoring services (optional: Sentry, New Relic, Datadog)
   - Notification services (Slack, Discord, Email)

### Required Secrets

Configure the following secrets in your GitHub repository:

#### Database Secrets
```
DEV_DATABASE_URL
DEV_DB_PASSWORD
STAGING_DATABASE_URL
STAGING_DB_PASSWORD
PROD_DATABASE_URL
PROD_DB_PASSWORD
SUPABASE_PROJECT_REF
```

#### Monitoring & Alerting
```
SENTRY_DSN
NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY
DATADOG_API_KEY
SLACK_WEBHOOK
DISCORD_WEBHOOK
NOTIFICATION_EMAIL
EMAIL_USERNAME
EMAIL_PASSWORD
```

#### Security & Third-party Services
```
SNYK_TOKEN
UPTIMEROBOT_API_KEY
GRAFANA_ADMIN_PASSWORD

```

### Deployment Process

#### Automatic Deployments
1. **Development**: Triggered on push to `develop` branch
2. **Staging**: Triggered on push to `main` branch
3. **Production**: Requires manual approval after staging deployment

#### Manual Deployments
Use the `workflow_dispatch` trigger in the deployment workflow to manually deploy specific versions to any environment.
