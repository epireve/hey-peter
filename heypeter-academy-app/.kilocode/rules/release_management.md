# Release Management Standards

## Product-Focused Release Culture

### Release Philosophy
- **ALWAYS** focus on business value and user impact in release communications
- **NEVER** expose internal tooling or technical implementation details to product stakeholders
- Maintain clean, concise changelog entries that speak to product teams and engineering managers
- Treat releases as product milestones, not just code deployments

## Versioning Standards

### Semantic Versioning (SemVer)
Follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) with product-focused interpretation:
- **MAJOR**: Breaking changes affecting user workflows or API compatibility
- **MINOR**: New features or significant improvements that enhance user capabilities
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes, security updates, and minor improvements

### Version Format
```
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
Examples: 0.0.1, 0.1.0, 1.0.0, 1.2.3
```

### Initial Release Strategy
- Start with version `0.0.1` for initial project releases
- Increment patch version for small improvements and fixes
- Increment minor version when adding significant new features
- Reserve major version `1.0.0` for production-ready stable release

## Changelog Management

### Changelog Standards
- **ALWAYS** update CHANGELOG.md with every release
- **ALWAYS** focus on user-facing features and business impact
- **NEVER** mention internal tools, task management systems, or implementation details
- Use clear, non-technical language accessible to product teams

### Changelog Structure
```markdown
# Changelog

### Changed

### Fixed

### Security

```

### Content Guidelines
- **Features**: Describe what users can now do, not how it was implemented
- **Improvements**: Focus on performance gains, UX enhancements, stability
- **Fixes**: Highlight resolved issues that affected user experience
- **Security**: Communicate security improvements without technical details

```

## Release Timing and Coordination

### Release Schedule
- Combine related changes into logical releases
- Avoid frequent micro-releases for minor changes
- Group features by sprint or development cycle completion
- Consider business calendar for major releases

### Date Management
- Use consistent date format: YYYY-MM-DD
- Combine changes made within same day or sprint
- Space releases appropriately for stakeholder communication
- Align major releases with business milestones

### Stakeholder Communication
- Focus on business impact and user benefits
- Use clear, benefit-driven language
- Highlight measurable improvements where possible
- Avoid technical jargon and implementation details
