-- Validate schema performance and security

-- This file serves as a placeholder and guide for validation steps.
-- Actual validation would involve using database tools and performing tests.

-- Performance Validation:
-- 1. Use EXPLAIN and EXPLAIN ANALYZE to analyze query plans for common queries.
--    Example: EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM booking_details WHERE student_id = 'some_student_id';
-- 2. Monitor database performance metrics (CPU, memory, disk I/O, query latency).
-- 3. Use tools like pg_stat_statements to identify slow queries.
-- 4. Ensure appropriate indexes are being used (check query plans).
-- 5. Consider further partitioning or other optimization techniques if needed.

-- Security Validation:
-- 1. Test RLS policies thoroughly for different user roles (admin, teacher, student, anonymous).
--    Ensure users can only access and modify data they are authorized to.
--    Example: SELECT * FROM users WHERE auth.uid() = 'another_user_id'; (should return no rows for non-admin)
-- 2. Test database roles and permissions.
--    Ensure roles have only the necessary privileges.
-- 3. Review function and trigger security (SECURITY DEFINER vs SECURITY INVOKER).
--    Ensure functions and triggers do not expose sensitive data or allow unauthorized modifications.
-- 4. Check for SQL injection vulnerabilities (though Supabase/PostgreSQL built-in features help mitigate this).
-- 5. Regularly audit logs (audit_logs table) for suspicious activity.

-- Example SQL for testing RLS (replace with actual user IDs and queries):
-- SET role authenticated;
-- SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = auth.uid();
-- SELECT * FROM teachers WHERE user_id = auth.uid();
-- SELECT * FROM students WHERE user_id = auth.uid();
-- SELECT * FROM bookings WHERE student_id = auth.uid();
-- SELECT * FROM leave_requests WHERE student_id = auth.uid();
-- SELECT * FROM materials WHERE class_id IN (SELECT class_id FROM classes WHERE teacher_id = auth.uid());
-- SELECT * FROM notifications WHERE user_id = auth.uid();
-- SELECT * FROM feedback WHERE student_id = auth.uid();

-- SET role teacher;
-- SELECT * FROM attendance WHERE booking_id IN (SELECT id FROM bookings WHERE class_id IN (SELECT id FROM classes WHERE teacher_id = auth.uid()));

-- SET role admin;
-- SELECT * FROM audit_logs;
-- SELECT * FROM user_roles;
-- SELECT * FROM system_events;

-- RESET role; -- Return to default role
