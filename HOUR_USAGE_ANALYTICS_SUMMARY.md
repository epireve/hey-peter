## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage Analytics
```typescript
import { hourUsageAnalyticsService } from '@/lib/services';

// Get student usage analytics
const analytics = await hourUsageAnalyticsService.getStudentUsageAnalytics('student-id', 90);

// Get balance trend
const trend = await hourUsageAnalyticsService.getBalanceTrend('student-id', 90);

// Generate low balance alerts
const alerts = await hourUsageAnalyticsService.generateLowBalanceAlerts();
```

### UI Component Usage
```typescript
import { HourUsageAnalytics, BalanceTracker, AlertManager } from '@/components/admin/hours';

// Use in admin dashboard
<HourUsageAnalytics studentId="student-id" />
<BalanceTracker studentId="student-id" />
<AlertManager />
```
