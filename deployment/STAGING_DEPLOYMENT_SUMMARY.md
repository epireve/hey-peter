## Deployment Components

### 1. Infrastructure
- **Docker Containers**: Application, Redis, Nginx, Prometheus, Grafana
- **SSL**: Self-signed certificates for HTTPS
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL (staging project)
- **Cache**: Redis for session management

### 2. Configuration Files
- `/deployment/environments/.env.staging` - Environment variables
- `/docker-compose.staging.yml` - Docker orchestration
- `/nginx/staging.conf` - Nginx configuration
- `/deployment/ssl/staging/` - SSL certificates

### 3. Deployment Scripts
- `deploy-staging.sh` - Main deployment script
- `seed-staging-data.sh` - Test data seeding
- `staging-health-check.sh` - Health monitoring
- `staging-smoke-tests.sh` - Functional testing

## Key Features

### 1. Environment Isolation
- Separate Supabase project for staging
- Isolated Docker network
- Test email service (Mailtrap)
- Staging-specific environment variables

### 2. Monitoring & Logging
- Prometheus metrics collection
- Grafana dashboards
- Docker container logs
- Health check endpoints

### 3. Security
- Self-signed SSL certificates
- Security headers via Nginx
- Rate limiting on API endpoints
- Environment isolation

### 4. Test Data
- Pre-configured user accounts
- Sample courses and classes
- Test hour packages
- Demo notifications

## Deployment Process

### Pre-Deployment Checklist
- [ ] Server with Docker installed
- [ ] Domain/subdomain configured
- [ ] Supabase staging project created
- [ ] Environment variables configured
- [ ] SSL certificates generated

### Deployment Steps
1. **Environment Setup**: Configure `.env.staging` with credentials
2. **SSL Setup**: Generate self-signed certificates
3. **Database Migration**: Push schema to Supabase
4. **Application Build**: Build Next.js application
5. **Container Deployment**: Start Docker containers
6. **Data Seeding**: Populate test data
7. **Health Checks**: Verify all services running
8. **Smoke Tests**: Test core functionality

### Post-Deployment Verification
- [ ] All containers running (`docker ps`)
- [ ] Application accessible via HTTPS
- [ ] Database connected
- [ ] Redis operational
- [ ] Monitoring services accessible
- [ ] Test logins working
- [ ] Email notifications (in Mailtrap)

## Maintenance Commands

### View Status
```bash
# Container status
docker ps

# Application logs
docker logs -f heypeter-academy-staging

# All logs
docker-compose -f docker-compose.staging.yml logs -f
```

### Restart Services
```bash
# Restart all
docker-compose -f docker-compose.staging.yml restart

# Restart specific service
docker-compose -f docker-compose.staging.yml restart app
```

### Update Deployment
```bash
# Pull latest code
git pull origin main

# Rebuild and redeploy
docker-compose -f docker-compose.staging.yml up -d --build
```

### Reset Environment
```bash
# Stop and remove all
docker-compose -f docker-compose.staging.yml down -v

# Redeploy fresh
./deployment/scripts/deploy-staging.sh
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Container won't start**
   - Check logs: `docker logs heypeter-academy-staging`
   - Verify env vars: `docker exec heypeter-academy-staging env`

2. **Database connection failed**
   - Check Supabase credentials in `.env.staging`
   - Test connection: `docker exec heypeter-academy-staging npm run db:test`

3. **SSL errors**
   - Regenerate certificates in `/deployment/ssl/staging/`
   - Restart Nginx: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.staging.yml restart nginx`

4. **Port conflicts**
   - Check ports: `netstat -tulpn | grep -E '3000|80|443|6379|9090|3001'`
   - Modify ports in `docker-compose.staging.yml`

## Performance Optimization

### Current Settings
- **Memory Limits**: App (1GB), Redis (256MB)
- **CPU Limits**: App (0.5 cores), Redis (0.2 cores)
- **Cache TTL**: 5 minutes
- **Rate Limits**: 200/min, 2000/hour

### Monitoring Performance
- View metrics in Grafana
- Check response times with health checks
- Monitor container resources: `docker stats`

## Security Considerations

### Staging-Specific
- Self-signed SSL certificates (not for production)
- Test credentials should never be used in production
- Email verification disabled for testing
- Higher rate limits for load testing

### Best Practices
- Regularly update staging with production code
- Use only anonymized test data
- Restrict access to staging environment
- Monitor for security vulnerabilities

## Next Steps

After successful staging deployment:

1. **Functional Testing**: Test all features with test accounts
2. **Performance Testing**: Run load tests
3. **Security Testing**: Verify security headers and SSL
4. **Integration Testing**: Test external integrations
5. **UAT**: User acceptance testing
6. **Production Prep**: Prepare for production deployment
